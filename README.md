# Decision_Tree--Classify_Molecule_smells

Task - To train and test a decision tree classifier that predicts if a molecule smells fruity, or not. 
To enable a data-driven approach to predict the olfactory perception of a molecule, we use the combined Goodscents and Leffingwell data sets, where experts labeled molecules with olfactory descriptors.
